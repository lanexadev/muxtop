# Security model

What muxtop defends, what it does not, and why. If you are about to run
`muxtop-server` on a host that matters, this is the page to read.

To **report** a vulnerability, use [private security
reporting](https://github.com/lucasschimmel/muxtop/security/advisories/new) —
never a public issue. Scope and response targets are in
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/lucasschimmel/muxtop/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## The uncomfortable part first

A system monitor is a **privilege amplifier**. It exists to show you things a
normal process cannot see, and the interesting features want progressively more
access:

| Feature | What it needs | What that grants |
|---|---|---|
| Processes, CPU, memory, network | `/proc` — world-readable by default | Every process's command line on the host |
| Kill / renice | Ownership of the target, or root | Ability to end other users' processes |
| Containers | The Docker socket | **Root-equivalent on the host** |
| Containers, rootless | A user Podman socket | That user's containers |
| Kubernetes | A kubeconfig or ServiceAccount | Everything that credential can read |
| GPU | NVML, `/sys/class/drm` | Nothing privileged |
| Remote | A listening TCP port | See the whole chain below |

muxtop's design goal is to make the **minimum** of that list useful, and to
make each step up explicit rather than a default. It cannot make Docker socket
access safe — nothing can — so it documents the cost and makes rootless Podman
the easy path.

## Trust boundaries

Four boundaries, from the outside in. Each is a place where muxtop assumes the
data is hostile.

### 1. The network → `muxtop-server`

The attacker is unauthenticated and can reach the port.

| Control | Detail |
|---|---|
| **TLS 1.3 only** | rustls. No 1.2, no downgrade path, no cipher negotiation to get wrong |
| **Mandatory token** | ≥ 16 characters, enforced at startup. There is no anonymous mode |
| **No plaintext mode** | The server refuses to start without a certificate |
| **Per-IP rate limit** | Token bucket, default 10 connections/s with a burst of 10 (`--rate-limit-per-ip`) |
| **Connection cap** | `--max-clients`, default 8 |
| **Localhost default** | `--bind` defaults to `127.0.0.1:4242`. Exposing it is a decision you make |

The goal at this boundary: an unauthenticated peer can achieve nothing except
its own disconnection. Anything more — a panic in the frame decoder, an
allocation driven by an attacker-chosen length, an authentication bypass — is
in scope for a report.

### 2. `muxtop-server` → the client

The attacker is an authenticated client, or someone reading the wire.

**Credentials never traverse the wire.** The server is the only side that opens
a kubeconfig, a container socket or a TLS key. The client receives digested
snapshots — numbers and names — and nothing it could replay elsewhere.

That is asserted, not just intended: the test suite in
`crates/muxtop-proto/tests/integration.rs` encodes snapshots and checks
byte-for-byte that no `BEGIN PRIVATE KEY`, no `Bearer `, and no
`client-key-data:` appears in any frame.

**The auth token cannot be logged by accident.** Both binaries wrap it in a
newtype whose `Debug` implementation prints `Token("[REDACTED]")`, so a
`tracing::debug!`, a panic message or a `format!("{:?}", cli)` cannot spill it.

**Host-mutating actions are refused remotely.** Kill, force-kill, renice and the
container stop/kill/restart actions are local-only. `muxtop --remote` is a
viewer, so a compromised client cannot use the server as a remote-execution
proxy.

### 3. Collected data → your terminal

The attacker controls a string that muxtop will render.

This boundary is the one people forget. A container label, a process `comm`
field, a pod name and a network interface name are all **attacker-controlled**,
and a terminal is an interpreter. A process named
`$'\e]0;owned\a'` would rewrite your window title; worse sequences exist.

So every externally-sourced string passes through `scrub_ctrl`
(`crates/muxtop-tui/src/ui/sanitize.rs`) before it reaches a cell:

- Replaced with `?`: every ASCII control byte — `0x00`–`0x08`, `0x0a`–`0x1f`
  (which includes `ESC`, the CSI and OSC introducer), and `0x7f` (DEL).
- Preserved: `0x09` (TAB), and every byte ≥ `0x80`, so UTF-8 process names
  render correctly rather than being mangled into `?????`.

A `?` where you expected a character is muxtop telling you the source string
contained a control byte.

### 4. You → the host

The attacker is a mistake.

- **Signals come from a fixed set.** Only SIGTERM and SIGKILL, chosen through an
  enum. There is no path that passes a raw signal number through to `kill(2)`.
- **PIDs are validated before any syscall.** A PID above `i32::MAX` would wrap
  to negative, and `kill(-1, sig)` signals every process the caller can reach;
  `kill(0, sig)` hits the caller's own process group. Both are rejected up
  front, on every platform, and both are covered by tests.
- **Actions are confirmed.** Kill, force-kill and the container actions show a
  dialog naming the target first.
- **Tab-scoped keys don't leak across tabs.** `F9` on the Network tab does
  nothing rather than killing the process selected on a tab you cannot see.

### Files on disk

| Path | Mode | |
|---|---|---|
| data directory | `0700` | `~/.local/share/muxtop/` (Linux) |
| `server.key` | `0600` | generated private key |
| `server.crt`, `server.fingerprint` | `0644` | not secret |

Secret files are opened with `O_NOFOLLOW` on Unix, so a pre-planted symlink
cannot redirect the write somewhere else. The certificate gets the same
treatment even though it is public — the write itself is the thing being
protected.

## What muxtop does not defend against

Stated plainly, because a security page that claims everything claims nothing:

- **Docker socket access.** Anyone who can reach `/var/run/docker.sock` can
  start a privileged container and own the host. If muxtop can read it, so can
  anything else running as that user. Use rootless Podman.
- **Running as root.** Then muxtop has root's view and root's reach. It does not
  drop privileges.
- **`--tls-skip-verify`.** It disables certificate verification. That is what it
  is for; the name is the warning.
- **A leaked token.** It is a bearer credential. Whoever has it can read the
  metrics.
- **`--token` on a shared host.** Command-line arguments are world-readable via
  `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` — muxtop's own Processes tab will show it to other users.
  Use `--token-file`.
- **A compromised kubeconfig.** muxtop uses the credential it is given, with
  whatever permissions it has. Scope it with RBAC — see [Kubernetes](Kubernetes).
- **The host's own resource limits.** A 1 Hz refresh on a 5000-process machine
  costs CPU. See [Performance](Performance).

## Hardening checklist

For a `muxtop-server` deployment, in descending order of value:

- [ ] **Don't expose the port.** Bind to `127.0.0.1` and use an ssh tunnel —
      see [Remote monitoring](Remote-monitoring)
- [ ] Run as a **dedicated unprivileged user**, never root
- [ ] Token from `--token-file`, mode `0400`, generated with
      `openssl rand -base64 32`
- [ ] A real certificate with a `subjectAltName`; verify with `--tls-ca` on the
      client, never `--tls-skip-verify` outside a tunnel
- [ ] Disable what you don't watch: `--no-containers`, `--no-kube`, `--no-gpu`
- [ ] Scope what you keep: `--kube-namespace`, a rootless
      `--docker-socket`
- [ ] Lower `--max-clients` and `--rate-limit-per-ip` to what you actually need
- [ ] Firewall the port to known source addresses
- [ ] Use the hardened systemd unit, and read the note about which three
      directives break which features
- [ ] Never add the service user to the `docker` group

## Privacy

muxtop makes **no outbound network calls of its own** — no telemetry, no update
check, no crash reporting, no analytics. The only sockets it opens belong to a
feature you enabled: a container socket, a Kubernetes API server, or the
`--remote` connection you asked for. It is intended to be usable on an
air-gapped production host.

If you observe outbound traffic that is not one of those, that is a bug worth
[reporting](https://github.com/lucasschimmel/muxtop/issues).

Its logs are local, at `~/.local/share/muxtop/muxtop.log`, and default to
warnings and errors only. They can contain process command lines, container
names and hostnames — worth a glance before pasting one into an issue.

## Supply chain

The binary you run is part of the attack surface, so the pipeline that builds it
is hardened too:

- Release archives carry a **build-provenance attestation** — verify with
  `gh attestation verify <archive> --repo lucasschimmel/muxtop`. This answers a
  question a published checksum cannot: an attacker who can replace the archive
  can replace the `.sha256` beside it, but not the signature.
- Every third-party GitHub Action is **pinned to a commit SHA**, so a
  re-pointed tag cannot inject code into a release. Dependabot advances those
  SHAs under review.
- Workflow tokens are **read-only by default**; write scopes are granted job by
  job.
- `cargo deny` runs in CI **and daily**, so an advisory published against an
  already-shipped dependency opens an issue instead of waiting for the next
  commit.
- CodeQL analyses the workspace on every push and weekly.
- A release is gated on the tag matching the workspace version and on a
  CHANGELOG entry existing.
