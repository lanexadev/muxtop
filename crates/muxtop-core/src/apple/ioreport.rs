//! `IOReport` access for the Apple Silicon backend — the *optional* half.
//!
//! The IORegistry gives utilisation and memory but says nothing about power or
//! clocks. Those counters exist only behind `IOReport`, the subsystem
//! `powermetrics` reads. Two things about it are worth stating plainly,
//! because the v0.5 release notes got one of them wrong:
//!
//! * **It is a private framework.** There is no header, no stability promise
//!   and no documentation. Every symbol here is resolved with `dlopen` at
//!   runtime, exactly as the NVIDIA backend resolves NVML, so a macOS release
//!   that renames or removes them costs muxtop the POWER and CLK columns and
//!   nothing else. The tab keeps working on the IORegistry half alone.
//! * **It does not need root.** The v0.5 notes deferred Apple Silicon on the
//!   grounds that `powermetrics` requires root, and inferred the same of its
//!   data source. It does not: the GPU energy and performance-state channels
//!   are readable by any user. `powermetrics` needs root because it also reads
//!   channels that muxtop never subscribes to.
//!
//! # Counters, not gauges
//!
//! Every channel used here accumulates. `GPU Energy` is joules since boot and
//! the performance states are tick counts since boot, so a single sample means
//! nothing on its own — power and clock are only defined over an interval. The
//! sampler therefore keeps the previous sample and reports `None` until it has
//! two, which costs exactly one tick of `—` at startup.
