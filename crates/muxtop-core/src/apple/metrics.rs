//! Pure derivations for the Apple Silicon backend: no FFI, no I/O.
//!
//! # Why this module is not `cfg`-gated
//!
//! Everything Apple-specific about the backend that can be *wrong* lives here
//! — the DVFS blob layout, the energy-unit table, the residency weighting —
//! and none of it needs macOS to execute. Keeping it un-gated means its tests
//! run on the Linux and Windows CI legs too, exactly as `amd_engine`'s parser
//! tests do. The v0.4.2 Windows break was a reminder of how fast platform code
//! rots when only one leg exercises it.
//!
//! The FFI that feeds these functions is in `ioregistry.rs` and `ioreport.rs`
//! and *is* gated, because it links `IOKit` and dlopens a Darwin-only library.
